      <h3><a id="about-btrfs" class="anchor" href="#about-btrfs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Btrfs and Docker.</h3>

<p>Btrfs (pronounced better-fs) is a highly advanced and fully stable Linux file system that offers many compelling and useful features like Copy-On-Write, snapshotting, Raiding, and thin provisioning. Btrfs is the default filesystem on some systems like Suse / SLES and is being used by some very large financial organizations today. Within Docker, support for Btrfs is available in the form of a storage driver as of 1.10 (both open source and commercially supported versions). While Suse / SLES include btrfs as the default filesystem, it can be installed on almost every other linux flavor like Debian / Ubuntu and Red Hat / Centos systems. With the problems we see in using devicemapper and questions as to devicemapper's maintainability given that OverlayFS seems to be gaining more focus and attention, btrfs seems like a very good replacement for devicemapper on Red Hat based systems as Docker's preferred storage driver.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>
