      <h3><a id="about-btrfs" class="anchor" href="#about-btrfs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Btrfs and Docker.</h3>

<p>Btrfs (pronounced better-fs) is a highly advanced and fully stable Linux file system that offers many compelling and useful features like Copy-On-Write, snapshotting, Raiding, and thin provisioning. Btrfs is the default filesystem on some systems like Suse / SLES and is being used by some very large financial organizations today. Within Docker, support for Btrfs is available in the form of a storage driver as of 1.10 (both open source and commercially supported versions). While Suse / SLES include btrfs as the default filesystem, it can be installed on almost every other linux flavor like Debian / Ubuntu and Red Hat / Centos systems. With the problems we see in using devicemapper and questions as to devicemapper's maintainability given that OverlayFS seems to be gaining more focus and attention, btrfs seems like a very good replacement for devicemapper on Red Hat based systems as Docker's preferred storage driver.</p>

<h3><a id="working-with-btrfs" class="anchor" href="#working-with-btrfs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Working with Btrfs</h3>

<p>In the sections below, we shall see how easy it is to work with Btrfs and specifically how to recover from disk out-of-space issues.</p>
<p>What we'll use here is a stock Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS system. We'll install Docker 1.11, the Btrfs package, configure Docker to use btrfs as the storage driver. We will then simulate a disk out-of-space issue and then look at steps to recover from it without losing any data or applications running on the system. For the purposes of understanding all commands are typed out by hand, and it is urged that these manual steps are automated to make the entire recovery process more reliable.</p>
<ol>
  <li> <p>Let's login to our Ubuntu 14.04 box and check if btrfs is installed and available. Since, we will be dealing with making changes to filesystems it will be convenient to run all commands as root (or use sudo to prefix all commands).</p>
  <pre><code>root@m1-host:-# btrfs
The program 'btrfs' is currently not installed. You can install it by typing:
apt-get install btrfs-tools
root@m1-host:-#</code></pre>
  <p>Expectedly, btrfs is not installed on this Ubuntu system<p></li>
  <li><p>Let's install btrfs as shown in the output message above</p>
  <pre><code>root@m1-host:-# apt-get install btrfs-tools

root@m1-host:-#</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>Now the btrfs command should work:</p>
  <pre><code>root@m1-host:-# btrfs --version
Btrfs v3.12
root@m1-host:-#</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>Also, ensure that the current version of docker is installed. The simplest way to get docker up and running is <code>curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh</code></p></li>
  <li><p>Btrfs works with block devices, so we would need one. Let's see what all block devices are attached to this system:</p>
  <pre></code>root@m1-host:-# lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0    0   8G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1    0   8G  0 part /
root@m1-host:-#</code></pre>
  <p>There are no unpartitioned block devices on this system. The only one is the one on which the OS is installed. We need to add another one.</p>
  <p>Since this is an AWS instance, I'm attaching two EBS instances, each 4GB in size.</p>
  <p>Running <code>lsblk</code> command now should reflect the new block devices added.</p>
  <pre><code>root@m1-host:-# lsblk
NAME    MAJ:MIN  RM SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
xvda    202:0     0   8G  0 disk
└─xvda1 202:1     0   8G  0 part /
xvdx    202:5888  0   4G  0 disk
xvdy    202:5888  0   4G  0 disk
root@m1-host:-#</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>We ned to change docker to use <code>btrfs</code> as the storage driver. Currently (as the default on Ubuntu), docker is using <code>extfs</code> as indicated by the output of <code>docker info | grep -i filesystem</code></p>
  <pre></code>root@m1-host:-# docker info | grep Filesystem
WARNING: No swap limit support
 Backing Filesystem: extfs
root@m1-host:-#</code></pre>
  <p>So, let's shut down docker before we make any changes</p>
  <p><i>Note: This is assuming that is a brand new docker installation and there are no images that need to be preserved. If there are, then those images would need to be either pushed to the hub / DTR or exported into tar files and backed up in some fashion.</i></p></li>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#mentioning-users-and-teams" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile.
